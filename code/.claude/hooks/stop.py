"""
Stop hook — Layer 2 of the state-drift enforcement system.

Job: before the agent's response goes to the operator, drain the dirty ledger.
For every campaign that was touched this turn:
  1. Re-render the campaign dashboard MD -> HTML
  2. Re-render tasks.md -> tasks.html and index.md -> index.html (if any campaign dirty)
  3. Re-build the campaign gallery (if asset artifacts touched)

This hook is intentionally NON-BLOCKING. It auto-rebuilds HTML silently.
Prose-drift detection emits stderr advisories that surface in the operator's
log tail but do NOT force a follow-up turn.

On success: clears the ledger.
On failure: leaves the ledger intact + emits a stderr warning so next Stop retries.
Never crashes the agent.
