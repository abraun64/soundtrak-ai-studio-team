"""
Surface-honesty guard (SYS-059) — a ✅ on an operator surface may sit ONLY on a
genuinely-gated artifact.

Behavioural rule it enforces (docs/workflow.md, "CM rules of orchestration" rule 8):
  "✅ on any operator surface means an explicit operator verdict — nothing else.
   Produced-but-not-gated artifacts (the Insight Brief, the concept moodboard, the
   concept trio menu) are inputs; they never carry an approval ✅. The only gated
   artifacts are the Brief, the concept pick, the Plan, finished assets, and the
   Phase-5/6 plans."

Concrete pain (real retro): CM stamped ✅ on the Insight Brief / concept-trio menu /
moodboard on the dashboard, fabricating an approval and eroding gallery trust. This is
the AUTOMATED backstop.

What it scans, per campaign:
  - campaigns/<slug>/<slug>.md   — the dashboard: phase table + artifact links
  - campaigns/<slug>/campaign.yaml — phases[].artifacts[].title

What it flags: a ✅ ATTACHED TO AN ARTIFACT NAME that is NOT in the gated set.
  - In the dashboard md: a markdown link whose visible text carries a ✅ — `[Foo ✅](x)`.
    (A bare ✅ in prose / a status cell / a history-log row / a budget line is NOT an
    artifact approval, so it is out of scope — rule 8 is about ✅ ON AN ARTIFACT.)
  - In campaign.yaml: an artifact `title:` containing a ✅.

Gated/ungated decision (small allow/deny list + heuristics, easily extendable below):
  ALLOW (✅ legitimate) — Brief, Selected concept (the pick), Plan, finished assets,
    Phase-5/6 plans, gallery roll-up.
  DENY  (✅ fabricates approval) — concept trio/menu, moodboard, editorial backlog,
    research, influencer/outreach targets, and anything that reads as an ungated INPUT.
  CONDITIONAL — the Insight Brief (SYS-067): approved AS PART OF the Brief, so a ✅ on it
    is a violation ONLY when the Phase-1 Brief is not yet approved (a pre-approval tick).

Public entry point: `scan(data_root) -> list[Violation]`, so cm_audit.py can fold the
findings into its report. Also runnable standalone for a focused report:

    python .claude/skills/cm-audit/surface_honesty.py

Exit 0 = clean; exit 1 = at least one violation (printed inline).
