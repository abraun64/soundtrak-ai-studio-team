"""plan_model.py — the canonical parser for a Phase-3 v3 Plan asset list.

ONE source of truth for a campaign's plan model, consumed by BOTH the plan
renderer (render.py) and the asset gallery (build-gallery.py), so the two
operator surfaces can never disagree about a campaign's channels, names,
descriptions, dependency waves, or Launch/Ongoing split.

A v3 plan asset table has a header row containing '#', 'asset' (or 'item') and
'type'. `parse_plan_markdown()` returns one dict per row with a computed `wave`
(dependency tier) and `stage` (Launch / Ongoing). LEGACY plans (no `type`
column) return [] — callers fall back to their pre-v3 behaviour, so nothing
regresses.
