"""SYS-020 cadence (a) — weekly COMPETITOR / LIBRARY SCAN.

Read-only + SURFACES only. It does NOT fetch, generate, or commit anything into
the library — it SURFACES a prompt/checklist of what the operator should pull in
(new exemplars + the System1 Ad-of-the-Week) as DRAFT library entries, reports
the library's current size + freshness from tenant/library/INDEX.md, and — only
if the library has not grown in N days — files ONE deduped inbox idea so a
stalled library surfaces even if nobody is looking.

  python .claude/skills/cadences/competitor-library-scan.py

Weekly schedule (see SKILL.md for the Register-ScheduledTask command). Worktree-
aware (resolves tenant/library + system/ to the main checkout via repo_paths).
