"""SYS-020 cadence (c) — STALE-ASSET / STALE-SURFACE SWEEP.

Read-only + SURFACES only. Two sweeps across all campaigns:

  1. STALE ASSETS — any asset.yaml whose status is a 'For Human Review' variant
     and whose file mtime is older than REVIEW_STALE_DAYS (parked awaiting the
     operator too long).
  2. STALE SURFACES — any rendered .html that is older than its source .md /
     .yaml (a surface that no longer reflects its data), for the operator
     surfaces a cadence can safely compare: dashboard, gallery, index, tasks,
     brief, plan, and per-asset previews.

It writes a digest listing both, and files ONE deduped inbox idea per category
when the category is non-empty. It NEVER re-renders, re-statuses, or edits
anything — surfacing is the whole job (re-rendering is CM's job, on a state
change, not a timer's).

  python .claude/skills/cadences/stale-sweep.py

Recommended weekly schedule (see SKILL.md). Worktree-aware (resolves campaigns/
to the main checkout via repo_paths).

    SCOPE (SYS-040): only flag surfaces the system actually re-renders on a state
    change. Two discriminators, both required for the per-asset case:
      - the .html carries the render-html PIPELINE SIGNATURE (every render.py output
        ships the breadcrumb / library-nav chrome), so it is template-rendered, AND
      - it has a SAME-STEM .md newer than it (the source the pipeline rebuilds from);
    plus gallery.html (build-gallery.py, from gallery-config.yaml).
    This EXCLUDES bespoke one-off artifacts a Producer hand-builds (mockups, slides,
    og-cards, storyboards, print specs, case studies). Those produced the original
    false-positive flood two ways: (1) no same-stem source, but a sibling asset.yaml
    mtime bump made every hand-built .html in the folder look 'stale'; (2) a bespoke
    .html that merely shares a stem with a notes .md. Neither is auto-rendered, so a
    timer flagging them is noise the operator can't action by 're-rendering'."""
