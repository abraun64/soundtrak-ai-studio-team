"""SYS-020 cadence (b) — monthly TENANT BRAND-DRIFT CHECK.

Read-only + SURFACES only. For each tenant it compares the tenant playbook's
last-modified time against the newest SHIPPED asset for that tenant, and flags
tenants whose playbook is stale relative to what's actually shipping — i.e. the
brand guidance may no longer reflect the work going out the door. It writes a
digest and, for each genuinely-drifted tenant, files ONE deduped inbox idea. It
NEVER edits a playbook, an asset, or a campaign.

  python .claude/skills/cadences/tenant-brand-drift.py

Monthly schedule (see SKILL.md for the Register-ScheduledTask command). Worktree-
aware (resolves tenant-brand/ + campaigns/ to the main checkout via repo_paths).

"Shipped asset" = an asset.yaml whose status starts with 'Approved' (the canonical
ship state), using the asset.yaml file mtime as the ship-time proxy. Drift = the
newest such asset is more than DRIFT_GAP_DAYS newer than the playbook.
