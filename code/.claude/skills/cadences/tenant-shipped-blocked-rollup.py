"""SYS-020 cadence (d) — weekly PER-TENANT SHIPPED / BLOCKED ROLLUP.

Read-only + SURFACES only. For each tenant, a short standup-style summary:

  - WHAT SHIPPED this period — assets whose status is 'Approved' AND whose
    asset.yaml mtime falls within the last PERIOD_DAYS (recently shipped).
  - WHAT'S BLOCKED — open (not-done) campaign-level operator_actions across the
    tenant's campaigns (the operator decisions holding things up).

It writes a digest. It files ONE deduped inbox idea only when a tenant has
blocked operator_actions older than the period (a decision that has sat too
long). It NEVER edits a campaign, an action, or an asset.

  python .claude/skills/cadences/tenant-shipped-blocked-rollup.py

Weekly schedule (see SKILL.md for the Register-ScheduledTask command). Worktree-
aware (resolves campaigns/ to the main checkout via repo_paths).
