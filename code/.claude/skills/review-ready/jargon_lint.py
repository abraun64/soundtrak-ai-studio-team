"""SYS-087 — operator-surface readability lint (the deterministic half of the CM
"review-ready" gate). Flags internal-system jargon a marketer-who-didn't-write-it
cannot be expected to parse. Pair with the LLM "cold-reader" pass (see SKILL.md) for
the author-context opacity a denylist can't catch.

The gate's two rules (its contract):
  1. Assume the reader is a MARKETER but NOT the author (no reliance on author context).
  2. No jargon unless it is marketing-industry-accepted.

Usage:
  python jargon_lint.py <file.md|.html> [<file> ...]   # report; exit 1 if any jargon
  python jargon_lint.py <file> --quiet                 # exit code only, no output
