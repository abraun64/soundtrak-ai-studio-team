# Phase 5 Launch / Day-1 Rollout — Spec

> **Plain-language standard (SYS-118).** The launch rollout is run by a human — often not the person who built the campaign. The **main prose must be plain language a non-technical operator can act on**: no code identifiers (script names, exit codes, slash-command internals), no internal jargon (dogfood, multi-tenant, content-subedit, UTM, au-sender-id, nav-crop), no unexplained acronyms. The execution "how" lives in the clearly marked collapsible `<details>` blocks and code spans, for whoever runs it — never the lead prose. CM runs the [`review-ready`](../../.claude/skills/review-ready/SKILL.md) gate on the rendered rollout before surfacing it (the lint skips `<details>`/code, so it checks only the prose).

**Spec version**: v2.2 · 2026-07-23 — the **sign-off gate is no longer a separate section**; it is now the FIRST thing inside **§1 Before you start** (sign off, then pre-flight), so the operator approves and pre-flights in one place. (Operator ask — act immediately + standard for all future campaigns.)
**Spec version**: v2.1 · 2026-07-23 — three operator-experience refinements from The Debrief review: (a) the **personal progress tracker moves to the top** (after §0, above the checklists) so the operator sees their progress before the work; (b) a **standalone internal-promo one-pager** (`internal-promo.html`) becomes a standard Phase-5 output; (c) **§3 handoff is never fully skipped** — always assume whoever executes the launch is not who built the campaign.
(v2 · 2026-06-15 — unified schema from the Beta Corp + Gamma Foods Phase-5 artifact review: Gamma Foods's step anatomy + Beta Corp's overview/interactive gate + ownership-model-scaled training + data-driven status. v1 2026-06-03 per Rollout Architecture v2 §5.)

**What this is**: the single self-contained per-campaign artifact for taking a campaign from **"assets Approved" → "live"** (and, where the tenant self-runs, **handed over**). One doc covers setup + deploy + training + dry-run + verification. **CM authors it — together with `phase-6-cadence.md` (for cadenced campaigns) — at the END of Phase 4**, the moment all assets are Approved (both seed from Plan §N "Phase 5 + 6 readiness"; don't wait for a phase to "start").

**Stored**: `campaigns/<slug>/phase-5-rollout.md` (markdown authoritative) + rendered `phase-5-rollout.html`.

**Authored from**: Plan §N "Phase 5 + 6 readiness" + Brief §Tech Setup + §Human Roles + §Cadence Shape + `tenant/<name>/integrations.yaml` + the tenant baseline.

**Locked**: at the end of Phase 5 execution. **THE GATE**: every blocker clear → operator approves Phase 5 closure → Phase 6 cycle 1 fires.

## Phase 0 vs Phase 5 — why setup EXECUTION lives here, not in Phase 0

**Phase 0 (onboard-tenant) is a DATA-COLLECTION phase.** It *authors* the durable tenant baseline — Brand Context · Compliance Profile · segments · market · `integrations.yaml` (config with **env-var refs, never live keys**) · seeded library · folder scaffold on the master. It captures **knowledge + config**; it does **not** execute the live technical standup.

**Phase 5 is the EXECUTION phase.** Everything Phase 0 specced as config gets **executed** here: install Claude Code on the operator machine, sync to the tenant OneDrive, provision **live** credentials into env vars, install templates into the platforms, deploy the campaign's assets, train the operator, run the dry-run, go live.

That boundary is *why* Phase 5 is one self-contained doc that inlines setup: the standup can't sit in Phase 0 (Phase 0 doesn't execute), so §2 below is where the config becomes a running system.

## Schema

```markdown
# Phase 5 Launch — <Campaign Name>

**Tenant**: <name>     **Ownership model**: <operator-runs | tenant-self-runs | operator-runs-then-tenant | outsourced-to-operator>
**Phase 5 start**: <date>     **Target completion**: <date>     **Operator(s)**: <the operator + designated tenant role>
**Plan status**: 🟡 Draft — awaiting your sign-off  /  ✅ Approved — execution may begin
**THE GATE**: every blocker below clear → Phase 6 fires.

## §0 Campaign overview   ← the operator's orientation; the part they value most
**Don't reinvent the wheel — REUSE the dashboard's 🧭 Campaign DNA block verbatim** (Big Idea · Key
message · 15-sec pitch · KPI floor · Full concept link), then add:
- **Key assets going live** — a small visual table (Preview thumbnail → links to the full render · Asset · What it is) of **3–5 highlight assets**, pulled from `gallery-thumbs/`, with a link to the full **Gallery**. (The Beta Corp foundation-assets pattern.)
- **What this phase puts live** — one line listing the deployables + the goals.
- **How launch day flows** — one line.
- **Link to the internal-promo one-pager** — a `> 📣` callout at the top of the doc pointing at `internal-promo.html` (the standard promo output, below).

A cold reader gets the whole picture — campaign + visuals — before any step. **Reuse > rewrite.**

## 📊 Personal progress tracker   ← MOVED HERE (v2.1): after §0, ABOVE the checklists
A `<div id="phase5-progress">` counter banner sits **near the top** — after §0, before §1 — so
the operator sees how far through they are *before* the checklists, not buried at the foot. It's a personal
overlay (localStorage, counts every `input.phase5-cb`); it states plainly that the **dashboard Phase-5 row is
the real scoreboard**. The trailing `<script>` populates it by id, so the div renders correctly even though
it appears above the checkboxes it counts. (The DATA-DRIVEN gate banner is separate — it stays in §6.)

## §1 Before you start — sign off, then pre-flight   ← v2.2: the sign-off gate is now the FIRST thing INSIDE §1 (no separate "✋ Sign off" section)

**First — sign off this plan.** This rollout was **built at the end of Phase 4** from the Plan + the assets actually produced — so it starts as a **Draft you approve before anything runs**. Two things to check:

1. **Is the plan complete + right?** Walk §2's steps — is anything missing (a deploy step, a publish step, a verify)? Add it.
2. **Gaps to close first** — assets / cookbooks this rollout NEEDS that don't exist yet (often a Phase-4 miss — a deploy cookbook, a logo/icon set, a referenced file). CM surfaces them here at build time; if any, **produce them BEFORE executing** (they go back to Phase 4 / Producer).

**Gaps identified at build time:**

| Gap | What's needed | Owner / source |
|---|---|---|
| <missing asset / cookbook / step> | <what to produce> | Phase 4 (Producer) — produce before approval |

*(or "✅ No gaps — every step has its asset + cookbook.")*

**How it surfaces (data-driven)**: while the **Plan status** line says Draft, the cross-campaign **[Tasks queue](../tasks.html)** and the dashboard To Do show **one** row for this phase — *"Approve the Phase 5 plan — Execute & Launch"* (🔴). The launch **steps** in §2 are **not** re-listed there: they live in this doc (checkboxes + live status), so the task list stays a decision queue, not a duplicate step list. `operator_actions.collapse_phase_plan_actions` reads this line to decide.

**To approve**: reply `approve Phase 5 plan` → CM trims the **Plan status** line to `✅ **Approved** — execution may begin (approved <date>)` (removing the Draft half) and re-renders tasks + dashboard → the gate row drops and you start working §2. **To send back**: name what to produce first (it re-enters Phase 4). Until approved, the steps below are a proposal, not a to-do.

**Then — pre-flight.** Binary readiness gates before ANY step starts:
- [ ] All produced assets `status: Approved` (check-state reports zero drift)
- [ ] Credentials at the keyboard (list exactly which, per step)
- [ ] No in-flight Producer/Brand runs that would change asset state mid-deploy

## §2 Setup & deploy sequence
THE SPINE. Atomic, dependency-ordered steps; group by environment (Claude Code/OneDrive ·
Email · Intranet · Social · …) where that aids scanning. Each step uses the step unit below.
Setup steps already satisfied for an existing/already-running tenant collapse to "✅ in place / N/A".

### Step <n> — <plain-language name; NO jargon, NO #asset-refs, NO "wire X" in the title>

**What this is**: plain English — what the step achieves for the operator + why it matters.
**Before you start**: prerequisites in plain words ("Step 1 must be live, and you've picked X") — NEVER `[depends-on: Step 1]`.
**How you'll know it worked**: something the operator can observe themselves.

<details markdown="1">  <!-- collapsed; the operator hands this to their developer/IT -->
<summary>🔧 Technical detail — for your developer / IT engineer</summary>
- Task (the actual deploy) · Cookbook link (full how-to) · Verify command · Rollback · Time · Mark-done propagator command.
</details>

☑ <interactive checkbox: "Step N complete">

## §3 Training & handoff   ← DEPTH scales with ownership_model (see table); never fully skipped
*(v2.1: **always assume whoever executes the launch is not who built the campaign.** Even `operator-runs`
gets a **light** §3 — pre-session reading + a single walk-through of the publish path + any skill/engine
install handoff — so a delegate could run it cold. Only the DEPTH scales, not the existence of the section.)*
- **§3.1 Pre-session reading** — links the tenant operator reads in advance.
- **§3.2 Day-1 live session** (<duration> — depth per ownership_model) — numbered agenda.
- **§3.3 First-N-weeks support** — the operator's commitment + cadence + SLA.
- **§3.4 Dry-run gate** — the tenant runs ONE full cycle solo, unassisted (the operator watches).
  This is what "trained" means; it's the human half of the gate.

## §4 Day-1 verification
End-to-end binary checklist, walked once every §2 step is done (incognito test, real signup,
event fires, first asset live, spend within cap, etc.). Each row binary.

## §5 Failure modes
Symptom → diagnosis → fix. The 3–6 most likely break points and how to chase them.

## §6 Status + audit history
- **Live gate banner** — DATA-DRIVEN: reads the dashboard's Phase-5 blocker count
  (propagator → asset.yaml/campaign.yaml → dashboard). Not browser-local.
- **Audit history table** — date · event · status. **The rollout plan can change from operator feedback;
  every material change is logged here** (a re-authored step, a moved gate, an added asset), so the doc
  carries its own change record rather than silently mutating.
```

## Standard output — the internal-promo one-pager (v2.1)

Alongside `phase-5-rollout.md/.html`, Phase 5 ships **`campaigns/<slug>/internal-promo.html`** — a
self-contained, brand-styled HTML one-pager the **marketing team uses to promote the campaign to other
teams internally** (not a published/audience asset). It is derived from material already in §0:

- **Hero** — the Big Idea + the one-line key message + the 15-sec pitch (reuse §0 verbatim).
- **Why it lands** — the audience insight in 2–3 sentences (from the concept).
- **The launch face** — the same 3–5 key-asset thumbnails as §0, each linking to its full render.
- **A facts strip** — cadence · audience · growth goal (KPI) · any sibling/context.
- **"How your team can use it"** — 3–4 concrete cross-team angles (Sales forwards an edition; CS cites a
  lesson in a QBR; everyone subscribes + reshares; talent/employer-brand). This block is what makes it a
  *promotion* tool, not just a summary.
- **CTA + footer** — subscribe / see-all-assets / full-concept links; a footer marking it internal-only.

Self-contained inline CSS + the tenant brand palette; thumbnails referenced from `gallery-thumbs/`
(relative paths — it lives in the campaign folder). The rollout header links to it with a `> 📣` callout.

## The step unit — TWO AUDIENCES (§2 — reused by Phase 6 §1)

Every step is written for a **non-technical operator first**, with the technical execution
**demarcated for a developer / IT engineer**. The operator must understand what's happening and
why WITHOUT reading jargon; the engineer gets the exact instructions in a clearly-labelled,
collapsed block ("there too", out of the way). This is the rule the Gamma Foods pilot revealed: a step
like "Wire #13 ESP `[depends-on: Step 1]`" is meaningless to a non-technical operator.

**Operator-facing — always plain English, always visible:**
| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Plain step name** | what it does — no `#asset` refs, no "wire X", no codenames in the title |
| **What this is** | what the step achieves for the operator + why it matters |
| **Before you start** | prerequisites in plain words — NEVER `[depends-on: …]` |
| **How you'll know it worked** | something the operator can observe themselves |
| **☑ checkbox** | "Step N complete" (personal overlay) |

**Developer/IT-facing — collapsed `🔧 Technical detail` block:**
| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Task** | the actual deploy action |
| **Cookbook** | link to the full technical how-to |
| **Verify** | the command/console check that proves it landed |
| **Rollback** | how to undo without cascade |
| **Time** | honest engineer time + any external wait |
| **Mark-done** | the propagator command (the source-of-truth status update) |

Same two-audience anatomy in Phase 5 §2 and Phase 6 §1 — the operator learns it once. Phase 6
cycle steps are lighter (Rollback usually n/a), but the plain-first + demarcated-technical split holds.
Any technical info an IT engineer needs MUST be in the block — present but not cluttering the human view.

---

## Status — data-driven truth + checkbox overlay

- **Source of truth = the dashboard.** Step completion is marked via the propagator
  (`propagate.py … --done`) or the underlying `asset.yaml`/`campaign.yaml` field; the dashboard's
  Phase-5 row + the §6 gate banner derive from that. Status cannot drift from the dashboard.
- **Interactive checkboxes are a personal overlay** (localStorage) for the operator's own tracking
  as they work a session. They are **never** the source of truth and must not be the only signal —
  the gate reads the data, not the boxes.
- The §6 banner shows N/total blockers clear; at 100% it states the approval reply that fires Phase 6.

---

## Ownership-model conditionality

§3 (training) and parts of §2 (system standup) scale with `ownership_model`:

| ownership_model | §2 system standup | §3 training | §3.3 support |
|---|---|---|---|
| `operator-runs` | minimal (already on the operator's machine) | **light** — pre-read + one publish-path walk-through + skill/engine install handoff (a delegate could run it cold) | ad-hoc |
| `operator-runs-then-tenant` | full standup on tenant machine | light Phase-5a setup → light 5b handoff | ~2 weeks active, then ad-hoc |
| `tenant-self-runs` | full standup on tenant machine | **heavy** (no pilot cushion — solo from cycle 1) | 4 weeks weekly check-ins, then quarterly |
| `outsourced-to-operator` | full standup on the operator's machine | **light** — internal handoff so any studio operator could run it | the operator runs indefinitely |

Setup steps already true for an existing tenant (2nd campaign onward) render as "✅ in place / N/A" rather than being deleted — the doc stays self-contained and replayable.

---

## Drafting discipline

- **Authored from Plan §N.1** — transcribe the deployment matrix + setup tasks + training plan into the live step form; don't re-author strategy. Plan §N is the static gate; this is the live tracking artifact.
- **Built in Draft → operator approves the PLAN before execution.** At build time (end of Phase 4), run a **gap check**: does every §2 step have its asset + cookbook? Is every referenced file actually on disk? **For cadence campaigns — does the linked Phase-6 cadence runbook (`phase-6-cadence.md`/`.html`) actually exist?** (A rollout must never link to a cadence page that was never built — the dead-`phase-6-cadence.html` class, SYS-117; the cadence runbook is a concurrent Phase-5 draft deliverable, so it should already be on disk.) List any missing pieces in the "✋ Sign off this plan first" gaps table — often a Phase-4 miss (a deploy cookbook, a logo/icon set). The operator approves the plan (or sends gaps back to Phase 4) BEFORE any step runs; the steps are a proposal until then. Phase 5 routinely surfaces "we need to produce X" — that's the point of the gate.
- **Human-first, two audiences.** Operator-facing text is plain English — no `#asset` refs, no "wire X", no `[depends-on]` in the step name or body. All technical execution detail (the concrete commands like "provision Mailchimp API key + set env vars + configure `integrations.yaml`") lives in the collapsed `🔧 Technical detail — for your developer / IT` block. Present, but out of the human's way.
- **Honest times.** Tenant-side tasks usually take ~2× the operator's estimate.
- **Binary verification + a rollback** on every deploy step — no "looks fine".
- **One gate, stated once** in the header and the §6 banner. No competing "Phase 5 closes when…" statements.
- **No phase-number drift.** Storage keys, CSS classes, section headers, and history labels all say *Phase 5*. (v1 Beta Corp artifact had `phase4` storage keys + a "Phase 6 status" header inside a Phase 5 doc — do not reproduce.)
- **§0 reuses the dashboard Campaign DNA + adds key-asset visuals** — don't write a bespoke overview; reuse the 🧭 Campaign DNA block verbatim, then a small thumbnail table of 3–5 highlight assets (from `gallery-thumbs/`) + a Gallery link. Rich, but reuse > rewrite.
- **Progress tracker at the top (v2.1)** — the personal checkbox-counter banner goes after §0, above the checklists, not at the foot. The DATA-DRIVEN gate banner is separate and stays in §6. Storage key + CSS class say *phase5* (no phase-number drift).
- **Ship the internal-promo one-pager (v2.1)** — always author `internal-promo.html` (self-contained, brand-styled, cross-team promotion) from §0 material + a "how your team can use it" block; link it from the rollout header. It is internal-only — never an audience/published asset.
- **Creator ≠ implementer (v2.1)** — never fully skip §3. Author every rollout so a delegate who did not build the campaign could execute the launch from this doc alone; scale §3's depth by ownership_model, but always include pre-read + one walk-through + any skill/engine install handoff.
- **Audit history (v2.1)** — §6 carries a dated change-log; when operator feedback changes the plan, log the change there rather than silently editing.

## Relationship to Phase 6 (shared spine)

Phase 6's cadence runbook is the same shape with the one-time bits swapped for recurring ones:

| Section | Phase 5 | Phase 6 |
|---|---|---|
| §0 At a glance | what goes live + the gate | the cadence + who runs it |
| Atomic step checklist | §2 setup & deploy (once) | §1 this cycle's steps (repeats) |
| One-time module | §3 training & handoff (conditional) | — |
| Recurring module | — | KPI tracking + cycle history + refinements log |
| Failure / escalation | §5 failure modes | §2 escalation paths |
| Status + history | §6 gate banner | §3 cycle history |

Same step-unit anatomy, same data-driven status, same failure/escalation pattern. Phase 6 adds the KPI/cycle-history loop and drops the one-time training. See `docs/specs/phase-6-cadence.md`.
